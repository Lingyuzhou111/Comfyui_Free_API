A realistic photo of the new iPhone 17, with a matte metallic orange surface that is non-reflective. The phone is held in the hand of a person in the photo, which is a close-up shot. There are three rear cameras on the top left, with the Apple logo in the center. The background shows the exhibition hall of the Apple event, featuring round ceiling lights, blurred crowds, and a lady wearing a black dress and a very low-cut top who is using her phone. The photo has a very high sense of reality, natural lighting, shallow depth of field effect, and a style similar to that of a DSLR camera.
