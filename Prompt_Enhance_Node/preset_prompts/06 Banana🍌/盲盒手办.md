Turn this photo into various derivative merchandise such as a character figure, a acrylic standee, a mug, postcards, cards, bookmarks, and badges. Behind it, place a box with the character’s image and the character’s name printed on it, and a computer showing the Blender modeling process on its screen. In front of the box, add a round plastic base with the character figure standing on it. This figurine is made of PVC, and set the scene indoors.
