Generate a real-life photo of a cosplayer portraying this character, with highly realistic skin texture. The cosplayer's hairstyle, accessories, and clothing must match the character's. She is sitting at a desk, holding a figurine transformed from this anime character's image. The figurine should be very close to the camera, with extremely detailed features. On the table behind the cosplayer, place a printed box of the character's figurine. Add a high-end 3D printer next to it, with a figurine being printed inside the printer. Set the entire scene in an indoor environment.
